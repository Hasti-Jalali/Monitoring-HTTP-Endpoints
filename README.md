# Monitoring-HTTP-Endpoints

In this exercise, we embark on developing a service in Python to monitor HTTP endpoints. Our goal is to track the response status codes of these endpoints at configurable time intervals (such as every 30 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes). By sending HTTP requests to the specified endpoints, our service captures and records the status code reports. Each URL is assigned an error threshold, indicating the maximum acceptable number of errors. Once this threshold is surpassed, our service generates alerts for the respective user associated with the URL. Successful HTTP calls are determined by response status codes falling within the 2xx range, while unsuccessful calls are identified by non-2xx status codes. Through this exercise, you will gain practical experience in developing a monitoring system that ensures the health and reliability of HTTP endpoints while providing real-time alerts for effective issue resolution.
